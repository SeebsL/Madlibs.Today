# Madlibs.Today
Today's madlibs, the next generation's style

## The Project

Develop a web application called Madlibs.Today that provides the same 
mad lib for everyone to fill in, with a new mad lib every day. The style will also be updated
periodically, so it's an opportunity to deliver new art every day, every few days, or every week.
The mad libs will be funny, provocative, or otherwise interesting and based on current events.

The day after a mad lib is presented for people to fill out, the stats for that mad lib
will be presented, namely what were the top ten or so words for each blank. 

Users will be able to sign in with either Google or Facebook. Sharing will be easy
and users can post what they made directly to Facebook. 

For more details, see the [Projects](https://github.com/mtpain/Madlibs.Today/projects) and [Issues](https://github.com/mtpain/Madlibs.Today/issues).
